We study the motions of complex molecules, how they are organized, and how they enable chemistry in a sub-discipline of both chemistry and biology.

I am a computational chemist. The duties of a computational chemist involve using computers to help perform experiments and research including single-molecule, bayesian inference, and machine learning.
